# RustPOSIX

Welcome to the RustPOSIX microvisor.  This serves as the OS-in-a-process in the Lind architecture.  For more details see the [main Lind documentation](https://github.com/Lind-Project/lind-docs).

Note this is a re-design of the original (now obsolete) [SafePOSIX](https://github.com/Lind-Project/nacl_repy), which was created using the [RepyV2](https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/docs/blob/master/Programming/RepyV2Tutorial.md) sandbox.
